## Python Package Explainer 📦🔍
Overview 🎯
A handy Python utility that explains any Python package by showing its summary, version, and top-level attributes if installed,
or fetching description and official links directly from PyPI if not installed.
Perfect for quickly understanding what a package does without digging through documentation manually. 🚀

## Features ✨
Detects if the package is installed locally and shows:

First paragraph of the docstring 📜

Version number 🔢

Installation location 📂

Top-level attributes and objects (functions, classes, constants) 🛠️

If the package is not installed, fetches:

Summary & description from PyPI 🌐

Home page and project URLs 📎

Latest version available 📈

Works with any public package available on PyPI

Lightweight, fast, and easy to use ⚡

## Installation ⚙️
Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.
Clone this repository and install requests (optional, but required for PyPI lookups):
```bash
pip install requests
```
## Usage 🖥️
Run the script with the package name as an argument:
```bash
python explain_package.py numpy
```
Or run without arguments to enter the package name interactively:
```python
python explain_package.py
```
