# Microsurvival üß¨ - The Microscopic Survival Game

Welcome to **Microsurvival**, an engaging and educational Python game where you control a single cell trying to survive in a dynamic microscopic environment. You must avoid viruses, toxins, and manage your resources like ATP, oxygen, and food. As you progress, your cell can evolve and grow stronger, adapting to the environment.

## üìú Overview

In **Microsurvival**, you are a **cell** navigating through a dangerous microscopic world filled with viruses, toxins, and resource scarcity. Your goal is to survive as long as possible by managing your **ATP** (energy), collecting **food**, avoiding **viruses**, and upgrading your cell for better survival.

Key Features:
- **Dynamic Environment:** The environment changes over time with fluctuating heat and toxins.
- **Cell Evolution:** Your cell can evolve to become more efficient in ATP production, movement, and defense.
- **Survival Mechanics:** Keep an eye on your resources (ATP, food, and more) and try to survive for as long as possible.
- **Upgrade System:** As you level up, you can choose from upgrades such as additional ATP storage, speed boosts, shields, or passive recovery abilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run **Microsurvival**, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.6+**: Python is the main programming language used to build the game.
- **Pygame Library**: A popular library for game development in Python.

You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## üéÆ How to Play
Objective:
Survive as long as you can by managing your resources. Eat food to gain ATP, avoid viruses, and level up to gain powerful upgrades!

Controls:
Arrow Keys / WASD: Move your cell around the environment.

R: Restart the game after losing.

ESC: Quit the game.

Gameplay:
You start with a basic cell that has limited ATP (energy) and speed.

Collect food scattered around the map to replenish your ATP.

Avoid viruses, as they will harm your cell. If you have a shield upgrade, it will protect you from viruses once.

As you accumulate experience points (XP), you can level up and choose an upgrade. Be strategic, as each upgrade significantly impacts your survival.

Dynamic Environment: Fluctuating heat and toxins levels will affect your cell's survival.

Upgrades: Gain the ability to upgrade your cell‚Äôs metabolism, movement, or even gain shields and passive recovery abilities.

Survival Mode: Every decision matters as the environment and your resources change over time.
