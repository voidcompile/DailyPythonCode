# Sentiment Analyzer - Python Project

## 📚 Introduction

Welcome to **Sentiment Analyzer**, a Python project that performs sentiment analysis on any given text using the powerful `TextBlob` library. This tool analyzes the sentiment of a piece of text and classifies it as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. It also provides the **polarity** score, which indicates the degree of sentiment.

The application runs continuously, allowing you to input multiple texts for sentiment analysis. If you wish to exit the program, simply type `exit`. You will also receive a daily motivational message after each analysis.
