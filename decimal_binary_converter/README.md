## 📋 Usage
From the Convert dropdown, choose one direction:

Dec → Bin to convert a decimal integer into binary

Bin → Dec to convert a binary string into decimal

In the Enter value field, type:

For Dec → Bin: a non-negative decimal integer (e.g., 42)

## 📌 Validation Rules
Decimal → Binary:

Only non-negative integers (e.g., 0, 15, 128).

If the input is invalid, an error dialog will pop up explaining the issue.

## 🌱 Future Improvements & Ideas
🎨 Support for Additional Bases
Add conversion between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.

🌐 Command-Line Version
Provide a CLI interface that accepts arguments (e.g., python converter.py 42 -d2b).

📊 Batch Conversion
Allow the user to load a text or CSV file containing multiple numbers and convert them all at once.

✨ Copy to Clipboard
Add a “Copy” button so users can easily copy the result to their system clipboard.

🖍️ Themed UI
Introduce a dark mode or different color themes for the GUI.
